Race day is nearly upon us! I'm sure lots of teams are frantically doing that _last one thing_ to their vehicles this evening. We would like to mention that there are still raffle tickets & programmes on sale, don't panic if you think they have all run out! Also if you don't have plans for Saturday night yet.
