At a well attended cheque presentation evening at the Wheatsheaf in Duxford on Monday 26th October a cheque was presented to Cancer Research UK for £11,000. The sum massively beat all our targets and is the culmination of the work of dozens of volunteers, sponsors and generous individuals. The committee would like to send a massive thanks to everyone for their efforts this year – we and Cancer Research UK greatly appreciate it.

The work for the Duxford Soap Box Derby 2016 starts here. Let us know if you would like to help.
