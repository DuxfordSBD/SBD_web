### £10,300! ###
#### This brings the total amount raised over the seven years the soap box derby has been running to  £61,900. ####

<br />

For those of you that were unable to attend the cheque presentation evening the chairman of the organising committee, Peter Stribling, had this message that he would like to share with you: 

*“As a committee, we are very proud of how the Soap Box Derby has grown over the past seven years. Apart from the money raised, it’s great that it’s also an event that brings the village together and has become a regular date in many other people’s diaries. Cancer is an illness which sadly affects all of us at some point in our lives. We are particularly proud that it continues to honour the memory of our friend Phill Hill and provides us all with a continuing commitment to fight this terrible disease.”*

Our representative at Cancer Research UK, Jo Marriott added:

*“Thank you to everyone involved with this year’s Soap Box Derby – what a fantastic amount raised again! We’re very grateful for the continued support of everyone involved in the weekend’s events. It’s fantastic to see so many people on the streets on the day cheering everyone on and enjoying the atmosphere. We’re pleased to keep the local connection by directing the money raised to fund research happening on Duxford’s doorstep at the Cancer Research UK Institute in Cambridge.”*
