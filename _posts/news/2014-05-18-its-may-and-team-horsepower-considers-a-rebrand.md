The winning team from last years event, Team Horsepower are considering a redesign of the classic kart from last event, and while ideasÂ are in the early stages, it seems they will arrive in much wackier style than before. Avoiding the "sleek like a bullet" appeal of the first kart, they are looking into following in the footsteps of the other teams, with crazy, funky "are my eyes lying to me" ridiculousness.

Expect something special from that team, but we have no doubt here at the official SBD blog that the other teams entering this years event will have some surprises up their sleeves themselves.
