The Duxford Soap Box Derby takes place in just over a weeks time on Sunday 1st September. Roads in Duxford will be closed between 11.30 am and 2 pm on Sunday 1st September while the racing take place. Please see the [route map][1] for full details of the route and which roads will be closed.

We would like to politely ask village residents that live along the race route if they could consider not parking their cars on the road for the duration of the race.

For spectators that are driving to the village to watch the race we have two event car parks available one at Welch’s transport depot on Moorfield road and another at Duxford primary school on St John’s Street. If you wish to park at the school you will need to arrive before the road closure at 11.30 am. Parking is free of charge, as is attendance of the derby, however this is a charity event so if you see one of our volunteers wandering around with a donation bucket please consider dropping a pound or two in!
