## The date for this years race is set: Sunday 3rd September

Once again the fourth  Duxford Soapbox Derby will taking place in order to raise money for [Cancer Research UK](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.531545,-0.106587&spn=1.0,1.0&q=51.531545,-0.106587 \(Cancer%20Research%20UK\)&t=h). Hopefully we can beat last years total of £11,800. Last year, like previous years, built on the momentum from the previous year and we're hoping this year will be no different.
