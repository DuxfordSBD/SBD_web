Relive the thrills, crashes and all out frantic dashes from this years Duxford Soap Box race! Thanks for your patience, we know a lot of you wanted to see this video.

We would love to offer the task of doing the video for next years event to another budding film maker - please speak with the committee if you are interested. It's a really thrilling job, running about filming the runners and riders and the edit of the race video is always a blast. Student film makers or a wannabe Steven Spielberg step right up!
