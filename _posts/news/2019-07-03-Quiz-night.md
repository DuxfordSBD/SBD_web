Please join us on Sunday 28th of July at 7pm at the Plough, Duxford, for a special quiz & bingo in aid of the Soap Box Derby 2019. Andy Yates will be the quiz master putting your general knowledge to the test for the evening.

As this was a very popular event last year we recommend that you book a table either by popping in to the Plough or giving them a call on 01223 833170 to make sure that you donâ€™t miss out!
