I wonder what we will see at our event this year? I'd love to see a team as Batman and Robin in the Batmobile. come on guys, theres time!

A few film/tv related ideas for this years teams.

Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millenium Falcon? McFly and Doc in the Delorean? Herbie? David Hasselhoff in KITT from Nightrider? Del Boy and Rodney in the Reliant Robin? Lady Penelope in the FAB 1 Rolls Royce? James T Kirk and Spock in The Enterprise? The A-Team in their van?
