We have been busy behind the scenes making arrangements for this years race pretty much since the chequered flag was waved for 2018's wooden spoon winners! As I'm sure you can imagine it takes a lot of hard work to put on an event on the scale of the soap box derby and we couldn't manage it without our team of dedicated volunteers.

Thats where you come in! Can you picture yourself wearing a glamourous yellow hi-vis vest like our race marshalls pictured above? Or perhaps your talents lie more in auctioneering or sales. We are looking for people to help us in several different capacities, including but not limited to:

 * race marshalls
 * raffle ticket sellers
 * auctioneer assistants
 * lost children/property
 
Each of these activities should not require much more than an hour or so of your time so if you think you can help please do get in touch, you can express your interest using our [volunteers form][1] or by sending us an email to [duxfordsoapboxderby@outlook.com][2].
 
Race marshalls must attend a short meeting on the morning of the derby where you will be told which point of the race track you are responsible for, and if you are needed for the childrens race, adults race or both. Full instructions will be given including information on manning the road closure points and contacting first aid support in the unlikely event it is required. Marshalls may also be asked to perform other small tasks during the race, such as carrying a donation bucket or handing out water bottles to the racers. It would be impossible for us run the races without our marshalls, they are incredibly important both in terms of keeping the competitors and spectators safe and also as cheerleaders encouraging the racers to keep on pushing at the points on the track where spectators may be a bit more sparse! 

Once the racing is complete focus switches to the auction which will take place shortly after the race at the Duxford Plough. This year we are looking for auctioneer assistants to help us keep track of exactly who buys each auction lot, what price the lot was sold for and ensuring that payment is taken and recorded correctly or the appropriate details are exchanged if payment is to be made directly to our [Cancer Research UK donation page][3].

If you are unable to volunteer any of your time on the race day perhaps you could help us prior to the event by buying or selling raffle tickets, these will be on sale at various places in Duxford including the John Barleycorn, Graystones and the Plough. Or maybe you, your company or your employer could supply us with a raffle prize or auction item, all donations will be greatfully recieved!
