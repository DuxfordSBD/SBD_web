It is with a huge amount of delight that I can announce the Duxford Soap Box Derby will return this year on the 5th September. With the recent [roadmap announcement from the UK Government][1] we believe it will be possible to run the event as by September social distancing will hopefully be a thing of the past. The committee felt social distancing was the biggest single challenge to host the event as this would have impacted everyone from competitors to spectators. 

Our ability to run the derby depends on how well the country has progressed along the proposed roadmap. With this in mind, we will be making a final decision on running the derby in late June. 

For now pencil in the 5th September, keep an eye on this website and our [Facebook page][2] for more information.
