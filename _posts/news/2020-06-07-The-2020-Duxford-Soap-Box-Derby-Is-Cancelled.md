It is with the greatest of sadness that we have to announce that the 2020 Soap Box Derby will not go ahead due to the coronavirus pandemic. After much deliberation the organising committee felt that there is too much uncertainty about what the new normal could be in September and it is unclear how we could make the entire event safe for all whilst respecting any potential social distancing measures that may still be in force. The committee has agreed to double down on our efforts for the race in 2021 and we will work hard to make that the best year possible.

We know the derby holds a special place in many people’s hearts whether that be that from participating in the event, enjoying the race day entertainment or securing the winning bid on a once in a lifetime prize at our auction. A year without it will feel both strange and sad, especially as we had hoped to honour our previous chairman with the new Mayor of Duxford award. The real loss though is to Cancer Research UK, who, like other charities, have seen a huge reduction in donations due to the pandemic. As a committee we are still working on ways to raise money for CRUK. Please keep an eye on this website and our [Facebook][1] and [Twitter][2] pages for updates on this. If you have any fundraising ideas, then please send us an email to [duxfordsoapboxderby@outlook.com][3] or contact one of the committee members directly. Our [Cancer Research UK giving page][4] remains open if you would like to make a donation to CRUK. 

Here’s to the 2021 Soap Box Derby!

Andy Yates, on behalf of the Soap Box Derby Committee
