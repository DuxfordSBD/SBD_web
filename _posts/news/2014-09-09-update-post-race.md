# Update post-race!

Hello everybody!

Last weekend was a stonking success and one that will go down is history, we feel.Â 

As mentioned in the programmes, please email any photos and video you have from the race to the web administrator (email on the programme) for it to be featured on this page, or included in the official video.

As with last year, we are putting together a video of the race, which we hope will be ready within the next two weeks. We got hold of more cameras this year and with two roaming cameraman on the route, the resulting product should be really exciting.

We will update you as news comes in! Send in your pictures and videos!
