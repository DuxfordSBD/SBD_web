Well, the race came and went in a flash, but not without alot of smiles, laughs, heavy panting, sore hands and feet and a few broken wheels on route. One amazing event headed up by visionary Duxford resident,Â ~~village idiot~~ **local legend** (and engineer) Clive Bartram. This blog is going to serve as a reminder to the community of Duxford, and their families on what a fantastic days racing this was. Keep an eye out over the next week for videos and photos from the day.
