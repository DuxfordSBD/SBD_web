As in previous years we are running a raffle with all proceeds going to Cancer Research UK. The draw will take place immediately after the trophy presentation for the adults race which will be held at the Plough on race day, Sunday September 1st. Tickets are on sale at The Plough, the John Barleycorn, Costcutter and at Graystones. Raffle prizes are as follows:

-  1st prize is £200 cash
-  2nd prize is a Champagne Dinner for 2 at the John Barleycorn
-  3rd prize is a £50 Voucher for Zara Indian Cuisine, Great Shelford

As well as numerous other smaller prizes. In addition to the raffle we will be having a charity auction, we have some amazing items that have been donated to us for this so keep an eye on this website and on our Facebook page. 

We are still looking for volunteers to help us with marshalling the races and assisting with raffle ticket sales and the auction on the day so please do let us know if you think you can help us out. We can be emailed on [duxfordsoapboxderby@outlook.com][1]
