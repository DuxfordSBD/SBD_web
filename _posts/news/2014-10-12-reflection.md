Duxford SBD founder and creator Clive Bartram (who took part this year at the reigns of his very own roman chariot) is leaving the village, and has handed over the reigns to the DSBD committee, who will continue this event for years to come - i have no doubt. The final fundraising total... well I will get back to you all on that soon as I get the figure!"

Hello to all Soap Box Derby fans and followers, Time has passed since the event where we saw such sights as Willy Wonka and an Oompa Loompa, two men in a bathtub, and Top Guns Maverick and Goose racing around the streets of Duxford. Duxford SBD founder and creator Clive Bartram (who took part this year at the reigns of his very own roman chariot) is leaving the village, and has handed over the reigns to the DSBD committee, who will continue this event for years to come - i have no doubt. The final fundraising total... well I will get back to you all on that soon as I get the figure!
