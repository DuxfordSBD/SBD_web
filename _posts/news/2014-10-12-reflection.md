Time has passed since the event where we saw such sights as Willy Wonka and an Oompa Loompa, two men in a bathtub, and _"Top Guns"_ Maverick and Goose racing around the streets of Duxford. Duxford SBD founder and creator Clive Bartram, who took part this year at the reigns of his very own roman chariot, is leaving the village has handed over the reigns to the Duxford SBD committee who will continue this event for years to come.

The final fundraising total ... well I will get back to you all on that soon as I get the figure!
