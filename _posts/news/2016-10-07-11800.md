![cheque-presentation-041016](http://duxfordsoapboxderby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cheque-presentation-041016.jpg) At The Plough on Tuesday night (4/10/2016) Peter Stribling announced the amazing amount raised this year for **Cancer Research UK**.

It once again beat all expectations. It is the culmination of the work of dozens of volunteers, sponsors and generous individuals who contributed by buying raffle tickets, auction prizes, making donations & attending the various functions.

Please see the “[Thanks To](https://duxfordsoapboxderby.wordpress.com/thanks-to/)” tab to see some of those who helped us out this year.

The work for **2017** starts here !

Put the date – **Sunday 3rd September** in your diary !!
