![cheque-presentation-041016]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheque-presentation-041016.jpg) At The Plough on Tuesday night (4/10/2016) Peter Stribling announced the amazing amount raised this year for **Cancer Research UK**.

It once again beat all expectations. It is the culmination of the work of dozens of volunteers, sponsors and generous individuals who contributed by buying raffle tickets, auction prizes, making donations & attending the various functions.

Please see the “[Thanks To]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/with-thanks-to/)” tab to see some of those who helped us out this year.

The work for **2017** starts here !

Put the date – **Sunday 3rd September** in your diary !!
