Last years winner Cameron Wilis-Wright teamed up with Karam Bhinder this year to give him his 2nd consecutive win. Well done guys!

The children's race was incredibly close and won by Ewan & Rory Percival.

Sebastian Jeffrey & Dominic Hines enjoyed it so much they went around again! And then they won the Fancy Dress Award.

The Constructors Trophy was won by the Dukes Of Hinxton (Hazard) – you may have heard them!
