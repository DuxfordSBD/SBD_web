Well – the 4th Duxford Soap Box Derby gave us another wonderful day. Slotted between two wet days, the threatened rain stayed away and we had another great days racing. In case you missed it – have a look at some great “In Cart” footage courtesy of the [3rd place Hexcel Composites team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IDc77eLM3g).

Last years winner Cameron Wilis-Wright teamed up with Karam Bhinder this year to give him his 2nd consecutive win. Well done guys!

The children's race was incredibly close and won by Ewan & Rory Percival.

Sebastian Jeffrey & Dominic Hines enjoyed it so much they went around again! And then they won the Fancy Dress Award.

The Constructors Trophy was won by the Dukes Of Hinxton (Hazard) – you may have heard them!
