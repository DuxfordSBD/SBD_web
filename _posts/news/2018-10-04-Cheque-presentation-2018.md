Sebastian Jeffrey and Dominic Hines as the Marvellous Minions, again won the Children’s race for the second year running.

A new course record of 7 minutes 20 seconds was set by Duane Webb and Nicolas Soffiati representing Hexcel Composites in the adult’s race, a remarkable time for a one and a quarter mile race. They were deserving winners of the Phill Hill Trophy for the fourth time! Best Fancy Dress went to Alison and Tim Foden who dressed as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. They so impressed the judges that they also won the constructors trophy for their soapbox.

Last place and the Wooden Spoon Trophy went to Liam Camp and James Reed dressed as Dimphree and Dumphree Dunlop of Duxford who always provide the crowds with a great spectacle rather than trying to win the race.

A cheque for £11,700 was given to Jo Marriot from CRUK at our presentation evening on October 2nd held at The Plough Duxford, bringing the total to £51,600 for the six years the Soapbox Derby has been running.

Events like this are impossible to run without the support of a lot of people, we have a list of the people that we would like to acknowledge here.
