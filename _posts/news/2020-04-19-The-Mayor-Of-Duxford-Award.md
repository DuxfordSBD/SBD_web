This year’s Soap Box Derby will be both special and sad. Special because it could be the first time that the village gathers after the restraints of social distancing - and sad because Pete Stribling, aka MAYOR OF DUXFORD, will not be there leading the event in his roles of Master of Ceremonies/Chief Auctioneer/Principal Joker. Indeed, it was at the very first Soap Box that he became the self-proclaimed Mayor and everyone applauded the appointment!

Pete has been the prime mover of the event for many years and was responsible for taking it from a small village event which raised £1,500 in its first year to a record amount of £12,000 in 2018. It was with his leadership and boundless enthusiasm that we were able to achieve so much and, it goes without saying, that he will be sorely missed.  

He absolutely loved the Soap Box Derby and we cannot conceive of doing the event without his contribution so we have come up with a plan that will ensure he will always be part of it - in spirit at least!

We are announcing a special award in Pete’s name - “THE MAYOR OF DUXFORD AWARD” and, of course, the trophy will be a Mayoral Chain! This will proudly be given to the best Fancy Dress of the day and the winners will be decided upon and presented by the Stribling Family.

This is to make you aware of this new ‘trophy’ and to encourage all of you who will be entering, to really pull out all the stops – it’ll be our way of saying a huge thank you to an amazing man, a true legend and the ‘One and Only Mayor of Duxford’
