Sunday evening saw us take over the regular monthly quiz slot at the Plough to raise money for the soap box derby. The teams that entered were challenged by a wide variety of questions ranging from the fairly easy to the fiendishly difficult! The quiz rounds covered everything from photos of well known "Celebrity Eggheads" to cryptic clues for motor sport competitors to general knowledge -  we even squeezed in a music round that had the bar staff dancing away as they carried on the serious business of serving drinks just before bringing out the half-time curry!

Half-time entertainment consisted of the "Padlock game" where keys were auctioned off to the highest bidder, with the winning key being the one that could open the single padlock that is fixed to the wall above one of the blackboards in the Plough. The evening ended with a couple of games of bingo with landlord Mario acting as the bingo-caller.

Congratulations to team "WOL" who came out victorious with a score of 64 out of 81! We hope to make this an annual event so keep an eye on our website and Facebook page if you want to take part next year. 

We would like to show our apporeciation to Tracey, Mario and everyone at the Plough for helping to make this such a successful and fun event - thank you!
