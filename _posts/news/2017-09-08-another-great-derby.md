The weather was kind, the crowds turned out in their hundreds and hopefully we will have made a lot of money for Cancer Research UK.

A new course record of 8 minutes was set by Duanne Webb and Nicolas Soffiati in the adult’s race, a remarkable time for a one and a quarter mile race. They were deserving winners of the Phil Hill Trophy and made it third time lucky. Sebastian Jeffrey and Dominic Hines as Dennis the Menace and Gnasher were first in their age group in the children’s race with Ashleigh and Keenan Burns winning in their age group.

Best Fancy Dress went to The Smiths - who can forget the sight of a pirate galleon racing to the finish line!!

The Constructors Trophy went to Del Boy and Rodney also known as Dave and Ian Brown, their entry of Barleycorn Independent Traders was certainly a hit with the photographer’s on the day and made for a great spectacle.

Last place and The Wooden Spoon Trophy went to Rupert Rolfe and Dylan Wilkinson whose cart, Dumpy McDumpface was an entry from Volvo Construction, a local business here in Duxford.

Our thanks to everyone who supported the event either by entering the race, spectating, buying raffle tickets/ auction prizes or donating money. Particular thanks to Nick and staff at The Barleycorn and Ben and staff at The Plough without whose cooperation and support the Soap Box Derby weekend would not be possible. Presentation of the cheque to Cancer Research UK will take place at The Plough Duxford 7.30pm Tuesday 19th September. That Cheque amount will available on this website after that date.
