## Who we are

Our website address is: https://duxfordsoapboxderby.co.uk.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we donâ€™t use it to track you individually or collect personal data. Instead it collects information about website performance and how users navigate through and use our sites helping us design better interfaces.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your anonymised IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp and similar information. We do not link this information to any of your personal data.

Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers [a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Who we share your data with

We do not sell, rent or trade personal data. We do not disclose personal information to others including third party services.

## What rights you have over your data?

Should you have any concerns about the way this website handles your personal data please email duxfordsoapboxderby@outlook.com. You should receive a response within 30 days of your request.
