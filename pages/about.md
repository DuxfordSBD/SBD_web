The Soapbox Derby began in memory of Phill Hill who sadly passed away from cancer in July 2013. Phill was diagnosed with Throat cancer in December 2012 and following laser treatment was on the path to remission. Unfortunately, once clear of Throat cancer, in May 2013 Phill was then told he had advanced kidney cancer and sadly passed away in July the same year.

Pam said: “After Phill passed away, his friends in the village wanted to do something to raise money and awareness of cancer. Phill was always into motor bike racing and the Grand Prix, so two of our very good friends, Clive & Helen Bartram, came up with the idea of a Soapbox Derby – something I’m sure Phill would have loved! Clive & Helen have since moved from the area but we are determined to keep this event going. There were lots of charities who helped Phill and we are grateful to them all, however having lost my mum to cancer as well I felt strongly that to raise money for Cancer Research UK may help beat cancer sooner.”

The Duxford Soapbox Derby fundraisers are hoping to raise significant funds for life-saving research to help more men, women and children in Cambridgeshire and across the UK survive the disease. Local people can support their fundraising efforts by donating to our [giving page][1] or by coming along on the day and cheering on the participants!

Ali Orr, Cancer Research UK’s local fundraising manager for Cambridgeshire, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the Soapbox fundraisers have kept the derby going and have decided to keep raising vital funds for Cancer Research UK.

“The Soapbox Derby is a fantastic day for the whole village. The group have been working very hard to put together a full weekend of activities to raise money for pioneering research taking place in Cambridgeshire. I am looking forward to seeing all of the carts on the day and helping to judge the prize for best fancy dress again this year!”

Ali added: “Cancer Research UK has made enormous progress in the fight against cancer. However, we have only been able to do this thanks to the dedication and commitment of our volunteers and supporters without whom we would not be able to fund our research.”
